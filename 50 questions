course：c_id c_name t_id
score: s_id c_id s_score
student: s_id s_name s_brith s_sec
teacher: t_id t_name

1.查询课程编号为01的课程比02成绩高的所有学生的学号、姓名、各自01、02课程成绩

select c.s_id,c.s_name,a.s_score'01',b.s_score'02' from
(select s_id,s_score from score where c_id='01') as a
inner join
(select s_id,s_score from score where c_id='02') as b on a.s_id=b.s_id
inner join student as c on a.s_id=c.s_id
where a.s_score > b.s_score

2.查询平均成绩大于60分的学生的学号和平均成绩

select s_id,avg(s_score) from score  group by(s_id) having avg(s_score) >60  ;

group by 和having搭配使用
https://blog.csdn.net/liuchunming033/article/details/47279003
1、GROUP BY 后面可以包含多个列，这就是嵌套。
2、如果GROUP BY进行了嵌套，数据将在最后一个分组上进行汇总。
3、GROUP BY子句中列出来的每个列必须是检索列或有效的表达式（但不能是聚集函数），如果在SELECT中使用了表达式，则必须在GROUP BY子句中指定相同的表达式。不能使用别名。
4、除了聚集语句外，SELECT语句中的每一个列都必须在GROUP BY子句中给出。
5、如果分组列中具有NULL值，则NULL将作为一个分组返回。如果列中有多个NULL，它们将作为一个分组返回。
6、GROUP BY子句必须在WHERE 子句之后，ORDER BY 子句之前。
3.查询所有学生的学号、姓名、选课数、总成绩


select s_id,s_name, count(score.c_id),sum(ifnull(score.s_score,0)) from
(score right join student on score.s_id=student.s_id) group by student.s_id

4.查询姓张的老师的个数

select count(t_id) from teacher where t_name like "张%";


5.查询没学过张三老师课的学生的学号、姓名

这样不对啊！

select s_id,s_name from score
left join
course on score.s_id = course.s_id
left join
teacher on course.t_id=teacher.t_id
right join
student on student.s_id=score.s_id
where t.name !='张三'；
那只能子查询了

select s_id,s_name from student where s_id not in (
select s_id from score left join course on score.c_id=course.c_id where course.t_id = (
select t_id from teacher where t_name ='张三')
)

6.查询学过“张三”老是所教的所有课的同学的学号、姓名

select s_id,s_name from student where s_id  in (
select s_id from score left join course on score.c_id=course.c_id where course.t_id = (
select t_id from teacher where t_name ='张三')
)

7.查询学过编号为01的课程并且也学过编号为02的课程的学生的学号、姓名
思路1：

select s_id, s_name from student where s_id in(
select s_id from
(select * from score where c_id='01') as a
left join
(select * from score where c_id='02') as b
on a.s_id=b.s_id
where  b.c_id is not null);
思路2：

select * from student  where student.s_id in
(select s_id from score where c_id='01')
and student.s_id in
(select s_id from score where c_id='02');

8.查询各门的总成绩、平均成绩和人数

select c_id,sum(s_score),avg(s_score),count(c_id) from score group by c_id;


9.查询所有课程成绩小于60分的学生的学号、姓名


select s_id,s_name from student where s_id in (
select a.s_id from

left join
(select s_id, count(distinct c_id) as b1 from score where s_score<60 group by s_id) as b
on a.s_id=b.s_id
where a.a1=b.b1);

10.查询没有学全所有课的学生的学号、姓名

select s_id, s_name from student where s_id not  in(
(select s_id  from score group by s_id
having count(c_id) = (select count(course.c_id) from course)));

11.查询至少有一门课程与学号为01的学生所学课程相同的其他同学的学号

select distinct s_id from score where (c_id
in
(select distinct c_id from score where s_id='01'))
and (s_id != '01');
答案错了

12.查询和01号同学所学课程完全相同的其他同学的学号

select s_id from
((select c_id from score where s_id='01') as a
join score on a.c_id=score.c_id) where s_id !='01'group by s_id having count(s_id) =(select count(c_id) from score where s_id='01');

13.把score表中张三老师教的课的成绩都改成此课程的平均绩点【update先不想看】
太难了！



UPDATE Score AS aJOIN (
        SELECT
                AVG( s_score ) AS t,
                Score.c_id
        FROM
                Score
                JOIN Course ON Score.c_id = Course.c_id
                JOIN Teacher ON Teacher.t_id = Course.t_id
        WHERE
                t_name = '张三'
        GROUP BY
                c_id
        ) AS b ON a.c_id = b.c_id
        SET a.s_score = b.t;

14.查询和02号同学学习的课程完全相同的其他同学学号和姓名


select s_id,s_name from student where s_id in (select s_id from
((select c_id from score where s_id='01') as a
join score on a.c_id=score.c_id) where s_id !='01'group by s_id having count(s_id) =(select count(c_id) from score where s_id='01'));



SELECT
        Student.s_id,
        Student.s_name
FROM
        Student
        JOIN Score ON Score.s_id = Student.s_id
WHERE
        Score.s_id <> '02'
GROUP BY
        s_id
HAVING
        COUNT( c_id ) = ( SELECT COUNT( c_id ) FROM Score WHERE s_id = '02' );


12.查询两门及其以上不及格课程的同学的学号，姓名及其平均成绩


select a.s_id, student.s_name, a.aver  from
(select s_id, avg(s_score) as aver from score where s_score < 60 group by s_id having count(s_id)>=2) as a
left join student
on a.s_id= student.s_id;

13.检索01课程分数小于60，按分数降序排列的学生信息


select * from student where s_id in
(select s_id from score where c_id='01' and s_score<60 order by s_score desc);

14.按平均成绩从高到低显示所有学生的所有课程的成绩以及平均成绩
这里涉及case when这个语句
case when 用于计算条件列表并返回多个可能结果表达式之一【不明白】

select s_id,
max(case when c_id='01' then s_score else null end)'01',
max(case when c_id='02' then s_score else null end)'02',
max(case when c_id='03' then s_score else null end)'03',
avg(s_score)
from score group by s_id order by avg(s_score) desc;

select score.s_id, score.c_id , score.s_score, a.aver from score left join
(select s_id, avg(s_score)'aver' from score group by s_id) as a
on score.s_id=a.s_id;

15.查询各科成绩最高分、最低分、平均分；
课程id、课程name、最高分、最低分、平均分、及格率、中等率、优良率、优秀率
中等70-80 优良80-90
select * from user where userId between 5 and 7;
查询userId为5、6，7的user，userId范围是包含边界值的


select course.c_id,course.c_name, a.max, a.min, a.aver, a.及格率,a.中等率,a.优良率,a.优秀率 from course right join
(select c_id, max(s_score)'max', min(s_score)'min', avg(s_score)'aver',
sum(case when score.s_score>=60 then 1 else 0 end)/count(score.s_id)'及格率',
sum(case when score.s_score >=70 and score.s_score <80 then 1 else 0 end)/count(score.s_id)'中等率',
sum(case when score.s_score >=80 and score.s_score <90 then 1 else 0 end)/count(score.s_id)'优良率',
sum(case when score.s_score>=90 then 1 else 0 end)/count(score.s_id)'优秀率'
from score group by c_id) as a
on course.c_id=a.c_id;

left join student
on a.s_id = student.s_id
where ran in (2,3);
https://blog.csdn.net/u011726005/article/details/94592866
rank 113
dense_rank 112
row_number 123

20.使用分段100-85，85-70，70-60，<60来统计各科成绩，分别统计各分数段人数：课程ID和课程名称



select score.c_id,course.c_name,
sum(case when s_score <60 then 1 else 0 end)'<60',
sum(case when s_score >=60 and s_score <70 then 1 else 0 end)'70-60',
sum(case when s_score >=70 and s_score <85 then 1 else 0 end)'85-70',

select s_id, avg(s_score), rank() over(order by avg(s_score)) from score group by s_id ;

22.查询各科成绩前三名的记录（不考虑成绩并列的情况）【有疑问】
where里面不能引用前面产生的列？也不能用rank等函数？


select a.s_id,a.c_id,a.s_score,a.r from
(select s_id,c_id,s_score, row_number() over(partition by c_id order by s_score desc)r from score) as a left join student on a.s_id=student.s_id
